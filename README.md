## Checkers game controlled by eye gaze


This project aimed to build a checkers game in which the selection of pieces and moves is done by tracking and gaze fixing. 
The application was developed in C++ in order to interact directly with the operating system and with the Tobii EyeX, the eye tracking equipment.
By capturing information and evaluating the program with different users, it was possible to determine the best gaze fixation time values for triggering in games of this type.
